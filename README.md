## Motivation
The primary motivation behind building this project was to offer a practical tool for coding boot camp students to assess their comprehension of JavaScript fundamentals. It aimed to provide an engaging platform for self-evaluation and progress tracking.

## Problem and Solution
The project addresses the need for an interactive, timed quiz that enables students to test their understanding of JavaScript concepts in a structured manner. It offers a solution by presenting multiple-choice questions, initiating a timer, and allowing users to save and compare their scores.

## Technologies Used
The project was developed using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
The project includes:
- Interactive quiz interface
- Timer functionality
- Dynamic question presentation
- High score storage

## Challenges and Future Enhancements

  ### Challenges Faced:
  - Implementing timed functionality accurately.
  - Designing a dynamic and responsive user interface.

  ### Future Enhancements:
  - Implementing a feature to review incorrect answers.
  - Adding varying levels of difficulty for the quiz.
  - Incorporating visual cues for correct and incorrect answers.
  - Allowing users to select specific topics for the quiz.

## What I Learned
